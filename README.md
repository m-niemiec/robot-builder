# Robot Builder

<i>Proper readme.md file will be added later.
Temporary description:</i>

I created this website in order to learn Django. In development I used of course Django, Python, 
HTML, CSS, BootStrap and a little bit of JavaScript. 

On this website you can build your own robot. You can choose if you want friendly or hostile one. Choose it's name, height 
and message for you. And then, you can randomize until you will find combination that you like!

You can check out this site live at - <a href="https://robotbuilder.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://robotbuilder.herokuapp.com/</a>

Cheers!
